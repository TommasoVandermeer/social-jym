# DIR-SAFE (DIRichlet-based Socially Aware FEasible-action)
A reinforcement learning–based local planner improving [[1]](#sarl) that unifies feasibility, safety, and social compliance for differential-drive robots. The method models the robot’s constrained triangular velocity space using Dirichlet-distributed actions and guarantees collision-free navigation via a lightweight action-space bounding algorithm informed by static obstacle maps. An actor–critic architecture with augmented state inputs enables efficient, real-time action inference without online optimization or simulators.

<b>ATTENTION</b>: Please refer to the "main" branch for the latest updates of the social-jym JAX-based simulator. This branch is specifically generated as a showcase for the DIR-SAFE algorithm for social navigation.

## Simulation videos
The first video depicts the DIR-SAFE algorithm operating in the parallel traffic scenario with 3 humans and 5 static obstacles. On the left, the video of the complete trajectory is shown and, on the right, the corresponding collision-free action space computed at each step is reported.

The second video shows a simulation in which A* is used as a global planner on top of the DIR-SAFE algorithm to successfully guide the robot from its starting position (bottom right) to its final goal (top left) in a cluttered and crowded environment.
